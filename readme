Web tech sem3 project

Sonam - login, sign up and home page
Kavya - feedback, scoreborad, quiz
Ruchika - content- theory page, about page


To be done:
Ruchika:
1) Change content in About Page (let the photo be)
2) If possible, give content for home page (do this last)
3) Add content to the footer, and change it in the basictemplate.html
4) Change the unnecessary parts of theory page like price etc, and what users have to say

Kavya:
<<<<<<< HEAD
1) Changes made in branch - Kavya.
   Merge them if no changes are required.
=======
1) Scoreboard : Have to align the text in scoreboard to center.
              : Make the upArrowButton functional. (Need Sonam's help for that, will be fixed on Tuesday)
2) Feedback : Making selection of ratings a required field.
            : Remove extra space after footer.
            : Make the upArrowButton functional. (Need Sonam's help for that, will be fixed on Tuesday)
            : Improve the look of the page.
3) Quiz : Have to add timer to all the quizzes.
          Direct the page to the next theory page/scoreboard on submitting the quiz.

Suggestions : The pages would look much better if the colour of navbar is changed to pitch black instead of greenish black.
